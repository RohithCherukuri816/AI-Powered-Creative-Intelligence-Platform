# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for uploading the AI-Powered Doodle Recognition and Styling Platform to Hugging Face. The system will enable users to discover, use, and contribute to the project through Hugging Face's platform, making the AI models and application accessible to the broader machine learning community.

## Glossary

- **Hugging Face Platform**: A collaborative platform for machine learning models, datasets, and applications
- **Hugging Face Space**: A hosted application environment on Hugging Face for running ML demos
- **Model Repository**: A version-controlled repository on Hugging Face for storing and sharing ML models
- **Dataset Repository**: A repository for storing and sharing training datasets
- **Gradio Interface**: A Python library for creating web interfaces for ML models
- **MobileNetV2/V3 Model**: The trained MobileNet model for efficient doodle recognition (lightweight, 100+ categories)
- **ControlNet Model**: The structure-preserving AI model for maintaining sketch structure
- **Stable Diffusion Model**: The image generation model for artistic transformations
- **Quick Draw Dataset**: Google's dataset of hand-drawn sketches used for training

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a machine learning practitioner, I want to access the trained doodle recognition model on Hugging Face, so that I can use it in my own projects without training from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the model repository, THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL display the trained MobileNetV2/V3 model with download capabilities
2. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL provide model metadata including efficiency metrics and accuracy for MobileNet architecture
3. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL include usage examples and code snippets for model integration
4. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL display model architecture details and supported categories (100+)
5. WHERE users want to test the model, THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL provide an inference API endpoint

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to try the complete doodle-to-art application on Hugging Face Spaces, so that I can experience the full functionality before implementing it locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the Hugging Face Space, THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL load the complete application interface
2. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL provide an interactive canvas for drawing doodles
3. WHEN a user draws and submits a sketch, THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL recognize the doodle and apply artistic transformations
4. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL display recognition results with confidence scores
5. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL generate and display the styled artwork within reasonable time limits

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to access the training dataset and methodology on Hugging Face, so that I can reproduce the results or build upon the work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL host the processed Quick Draw dataset used for training
2. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL provide dataset statistics and category distributions
3. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL include data preprocessing scripts and documentation
4. WHEN researchers access the dataset, THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL provide download capabilities in standard formats
5. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL link to the training notebook and methodology documentation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a community member, I want to contribute improvements to the project through Hugging Face, so that I can help enhance the model performance and features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL enable community discussions and feedback on model repositories
2. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL support version control for model updates and improvements
3. WHEN contributors submit improvements, THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL provide merge request capabilities
4. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL display contribution guidelines and development setup instructions
5. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL track and display contributor acknowledgments

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily discover and understand the project capabilities on Hugging Face, so that I can quickly assess if it meets my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL display comprehensive project documentation with clear descriptions
2. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL provide visual examples of input sketches and output artwork
3. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL include performance benchmarks and system requirements
4. WHEN users browse the repositories, THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL show clear licensing information (MIT)
5. THE Hugging Face Platform SHALL provide links to related resources and documentation
